Once Upon A Time
Nothing happened at all
It was just boring
A boring world where nothing happened
This world was called Terra Prime
Nothing ever happened on Terra Prime
Nothing exciting happened
Nothing fun EVER happened
That was until...
A Meteor hit the Planet causing devasting damage to the land
People were moved to stop Terra Prime from burning down
They made many stone buckets to put out The Great World Fire as it came to be known
Many died to the fire
But eventually the fire was put out and the land was saved
Afterwards most of the people sank back into the boringness of before
The many buckets they had made sat wasting away...
The many things that had been made sat wasting away
Everthing was boring once more
